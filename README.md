# Havamal as a JavaScript Array

## Source
The Words of Odin the High One ([source](https://www.pitt.edu/~dash/havamal.html))
from the [Elder or Poetic Edda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetic_Edda)
(SÃ¦mund's Edda)
translated by Olive Bray

## Why?

Stoic philosophy has become popular these days. What did other warrior cultures study as part of their philosophy? Perhaps the vikings has something useful. I dug up the words of wisdom and display them here.

This was a fun project for taking text and turning it into JavaScript notation. It was good practice with regular expressions.

PRAIS ODIN!

## Alternate Uses

The display.js file would be capable of taking any nested array writing and displaying it cleanly for a boiler plate project. If you decide to use this project for that, please let me know and I'd be happy to list your project here.
